Welcome! This here is our new blog! As is fitting of a new journal let's start ourselves off with an introduction to Sittercity Tech.

####  What we do

So! [Sittercity](https://www.sittercity.com). What do we do? Sittercity is a service that connects families and sitters. Our goal is to
help parents find the best caregiver possible for their child.

From a technology perspective this means providing a highly available platform in the form of our site for parents to post jobs, sitters to search for the best
opportunities, and for both sides to communicate and organize childcare opportunities. In addition, there are a myriad of background processes surrounding
safety, additional communication, and other supporting services that help us deliver a high quality product for our customers.

#### Technology

From a technology perspective we are in a state of transition (which we plan to discuss more in the coming weeks). We are primarily a ruby shop
at the moment and most of our engineers consider themselves rubyists. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) does a lot of heavy lifting in our stack
but we have evolved into a true polyglot shop over the last few months, with [Golang](http://golang.org) making a large impact on our internal ecosystem. We're moving away from
a large-scale rails project and into the world of microservices. Definitely look for more on this front.

On the Operations side we are an AWS shop and are quickly transitioning into the world of [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/), which has a huge impact on
how we develop and deliver projects in the future.

#### Design Principles

Sittercity Tech is filled with highly opinionated individuals and that's the way we like it. We all care deeply about the 'right' way to accomplish a 
task (even though we tend to disagree on what that might mean). We feel very strongly that it is extremely important to fill our team with 
passionate people that really, really want to develop high-quality code.

We are huge, huge proponents of [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and attempt to apply it to all aspects of our development 
work. We consider ourselves an agile (lower-case 'a') shop, running one or two week sprints and performing daily stand-ups to provide updates on our status. We're constantly looking
to improve our processes, however, as evidenced by our recent shift to a [continuous delivery model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery). We pick and choose
the best aspects of agile to help us achieve our goals.

We are also big believers in [test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). We strive for 100% test coverage and expect all developers to
write tests before writing code and to be constantly running the test suite.

#### Sneak peak at upcoming topics

So what do we have planned for the coming weeks? We have a few topics on the pipeline:

* Introduction of Go into our stack
* Creation of Go tools
* A look into quality assurance at Sittercity
* Our evolution into a true polygot shop
* Time effective tests and test-driven development

Stay tuned!
